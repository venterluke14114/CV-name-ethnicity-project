This project takes data from a landmark field experiment conducted by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004). In this randomized controlled experiment, 4,870 fictitious résumés were sent in response to real employment advertisements in Chicago and Boston
during 2001. This study hoped to see if the ethnicty of a person's name affects their likelyhood of being called by to an interview. The data was analysed and a full report drawn up in report.pdf.
